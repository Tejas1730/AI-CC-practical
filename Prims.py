Primâ€™s Algorithm â€“ Theory
ðŸŽ¯ Goal:
Build a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) by growing the tree one vertex at a time:

Always pick the smallest edge that connects a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside it

 Key Idea:
Start with any node.

Repeatedly add the smallest edge that connects the MST to a new vertex.

Continue until all vertices are included in the MST.

ðŸ“‹ Input:
A connected, undirected graph with V vertices and E weighted edges

1. Initialize a set MST[] to store MST vertices.
2. Create a min-priority queue (min-heap) to pick the edge with the smallest weight.
3. Start from any vertex (e.g., vertex 0):
   - Set its key = 0 and all others to âˆž.
4. While MST doesn't include all vertices:
   a. Pick the vertex `u` with the smallest key value not yet in MST.
   b. Include `u` in MST.
   c. For every adjacent vertex `v` of `u`:
       - If `v` not in MST and weight(u, v) < key[v], update key[v]
5. Output the selected edges and their total weight.

ðŸ§® Time and Space Complexity
Using Min-Heap:
Time Complexity: O((V + E) log V)
(with priority queue and adjacency list)

Space Complexity: O(V) for MST set and O(E) for edge list
