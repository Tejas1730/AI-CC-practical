 N-Queens Problem â€“ Theory
ðŸ§  Goal:
Place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that:

No two queens attack each other.

A queen can attack:

Horizontally

Vertically

Diagonally

 Approach: Backtracking
ðŸŒ± Basic Idea:
Start placing queens row by row.

For each row, try placing a queen in all columns.

Before placing, check if the position is safe.

If yes, move to the next row.

If placing a queen leads to no solution, backtrack and try the next column.

solveNQueens(board, row):
    if row == N:
        print/collect the board configuration
        return

    for col in 0 to N-1:
        if isSafe(board, row, col):
            place queen at (row, col)
            solveNQueens(board, row + 1)
            remove queen from (row, col)  // backtrack
ðŸ”Ž isSafe(board, row, col):
Check:

Column: No queen in the same column above

Upper-left diagonal

Upper-right diagonal
Time Complexity: O(N!)
(Each queen can go to N columns in worst case, reducing choices row-wise)

Space Complexity: O(NÂ²) for the board or O(N) for column/diagonal trackers

 Applications:
Constraint satisfaction problems

AI and game theory

Parallel task scheduling

Genetic algorithms (fitness functions)
