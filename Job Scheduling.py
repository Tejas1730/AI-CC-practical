 Job Scheduling â€“ Theory
ðŸŽ¯ Goal:
Schedule jobs in such a way that:

Each job takes 1 unit of time

No two jobs overlap

Each job has:

A deadline (by when it must be done)

A profit (earned if job is completed before the deadline)

ðŸŸ¢ Objective: Maximize total profit by selecting and scheduling the most profitable jobs before their deadlines.
An array of n jobs. Each job has:

An id (Job identifier)

A deadline (latest time slot by which it must be completed)

A profit (earned if job is done within deadline)

Step-by-step:
Sort all jobs in decreasing order of profit.

Find the maximum deadline to determine how many time slots are needed.

Create a slot array of size equal to max deadline, initialized as empty.

Iterate through sorted jobs and for each job:

Try to place it in the latest available time slot before its deadline.

If a slot is free, schedule the job there.

Collect and return scheduled jobs and total profit.
Time Complexity:

Sorting jobs: O(n log n)

Scheduling: O(n Ã— d) where d = max deadline

Space Complexity:

O(d) for slot array
