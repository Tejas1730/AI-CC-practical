 BFS (Breadth-First Search)
ðŸ§  Theory
Explores the graph level by level (breadth-wise).

Uses a queue (FIFO) to keep track of nodes to visit.

Best for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Visits all neighbors before moving deeper.

BFS(graph, start):
    create an empty set visited
    create a queue Q
    enqueue start into Q
    mark start as visited

    while Q is not empty:
        current = dequeue Q
        process(current)
        for each neighbor of current:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                mark neighbor as visited
                enqueue neighbor into Q
Time: O(V + E)

Space: O(V) â€” for visited and queue

 DFS (Depth-First Search)
ðŸ§  Theory
Explores the graph deeply first (depth-wise).

Uses a stack (LIFO) or recursion.

Goes as far as possible along one branch before backtracking.

Good for topological sorting, cycle detection, etc.
DFS(graph, start):
    create an empty set visited
    call DFS_Visit(start)

DFS_Visit(node):
    mark node as visited
    process(node)
    for each neighbor of node:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            DFS_Visit(neighbor)
Time: O(V + E)

Space: O(V) â€” for visited and stack/recursion
